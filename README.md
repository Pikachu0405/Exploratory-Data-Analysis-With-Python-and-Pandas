# Exploratory-Data-Analysis-With-Python-and-Pandas

1. Apply practical Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques on any tabular dataset using Python packages such as Pandas and Numpy.

2. Produce data visualizations using Seaborn and Matplotlib


**Project Implementation and Takeaways --**

1. Initial Data Exploration: Read in data, take a glimpse at a few rows, calculate some summary statistics.

2. Univariate Analysis: Analyze continuous and categorical variables, one variable at a time.

3. Bivariate Analysis: Looking at the relationship between two variables at a time.

4. Identify and Handling Duplicate and Missing Data: Find and remove duplicate rows, and replace missing values with their mean and mode.

5. Correlation Analysis: Looking at the correlation of numerical variables in the dataset and interpreting the numbers.
